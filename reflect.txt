Reflection
Workshop 8 focused on many learning outcomes and I would say that it was very different 
compared to other workshops. Creating abstract base classes was very new and it very
similar to the class website examples. However, I believe the "implement behaviour using
virtual functions" out the learning outcomes was the hardest out of all to pick up on. 
There is a difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class required a lot of 
reading. Using the ICT Seneca website the difference is abstract classes are base classes and
concrete classes are dervived classes and they are create through interface. This difference can
be seen in the names. An abstract base class is "abstract" all of the method used are abstract
in this class, while concrete classes are "concrete" are dont have abstract methods of 
resolving and running.
