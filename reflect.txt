Reflection
Workshop 8 focused on many learning outcomes and I would say that it was very different 
compared to other workshops. Creating abstract base classes was very new and very
similar to the class website examples. However, I believe the "implement behaviour using
virtual functions" out the learning outcomes was the hardest out of all to pick up on. 
There is a difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class that required a lot of 
reading. Using the ICT Seneca website the difference is abstract classes are base classes and
concrete classes are derived classes and they are created through the interface. This difference can
be seen in the names. An abstract base class is "abstract" all of the method used is abstract in this
class, while concrete classes are "concrete" are don't have abstract methods of 
resolving and running.
